:::tip[Qt Switch between versions]

If you run a Qt version different from the one of the previous time, it may lead to errors.
This is because All Qt versions used the same location for saving settings. To avoid such errors, you may backup the settings for individual versions.

The locations of Qt settings :

`Linux:  ~/.config/QtProject`

`Windows:  %appdata%/QtProject `

:::

Before running of Qt Creator, we need to set the 
environment variables. 

Open a terminal window, input the commands, 

```
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
source /opt/poky/3.1.26/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
```

Run Qtcreator ( Qt5.6.3 ) 
```
cd ~/Qt5.6.3/Tools/QtCreator/bin/
./qtcreator
```

Select the menu of Qt Creator
