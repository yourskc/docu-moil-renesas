# 5-5 Build Qt Project on Ubuntu 22.04 

We are about to create project, open an example 
project for pratice or create a blank new project. 

**Examples**

Open Qt Creator, click on the ```Welcome``` on the left, click on ```Examples``` and browse to example projects, 

Or, you can start from a blank project,

**New Project** 

In the menu, choose ```File/ New File or Project/``` 

Choose  ```"Application"/ "Qt Quick Control Application"```

Input project name, for example ```ex01```

In "Kit" selection dislog, choose "Desktop Qt 5.6.3 GCC 64bit"

Press green triangle button on the lower-left or press F5 or Ctrl-R to start execution

Since the selected kits is "Desktop", the built executables can be run on PC as below,  

![img](/img/Qt563_ex01.png)

The executable would be in another folder named as 

```/build-ex01-Desktop_Qt_5_6_3_GCC_64bit-Debug ```

you can also double click on the executable to run it outside of At Creator.

The success of the above steps means We've completely build a environment for development.

You can do the software development to meet your project need by repeating the programming and debugging procedures. 

Start from some example projects come with Qt installation is a good way to quickly learn the Qt UI programming. You can add controls like buttons, design the layout, and write program behind the controls to connect them with others.

you can start by familiar with those topics,
